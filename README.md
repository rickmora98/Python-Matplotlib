<h1> Pymaceuticals <br> (A Demonstration of Matplotlib Visualizations in Data Analysis) </h1>

This Jupyter notebook (pymaceuticals.ipynb) analyzes a fictitious cancer treatment drug study. It first merges and cleans the raw data
contained in two CSV files. It then tabulates several statistics using Pandas and then illustrates further analyses using Matplotlib.

To examine the code and data files, their locations are indicated in the tree below:

#### Folders/Files:

> **"Pymaceuticals"** (main folder) <br>
> - *"pymaceuticals.ipynb"* (jupyter notebook file containing python/pandas code) <br>
> - **"data"** (subfolder) <br>
>	- *"Mouse_metadata.csv"* (input data file) <br>
> 	- *"Study_results.csv"* (input data file) <br>
	
(Please do not move, rename, delete, or alter!)
